**Team Members:** Sheldon Shaw 
**Status:**  Go

##  Project Overview
**DealDetective** is a Python-based application designed to help online shoppers find the **best deals** across multiple e-commerce sites.  
Using **web scraping**, **price comparison**, and **alert notifications**, it aims to save money for users who frequently shop online — especially students and parents looking for discounts on the same products.

---

##  Project Goals
- Compare prices across several e-commerce websites.  
- Track price changes and display historical price trends.  
- Allow users to set custom **price-drop alerts**.  
- Provide a simple, user-friendly interface for deal searching.

##  Technologies & Tools
- **Python 3**  
- **BeautifulSoup4** → web scraping  
- **Requests** → data retrieval  
- **Pandas** → data processing  
- **Flask** or **Streamlit** → web interface (to decide in Sprint 2)
